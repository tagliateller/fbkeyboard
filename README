fbkeyboard

This is a framebuffer softkeyboard for use on devices with touchscreen input like smartphones.
It was designed for the linux text console.
It uses freetype2 lib to render fonts.
Keystrokes will be send to the kernel using uinput.

How to build:
Just run make in this directory.

How to run:
# ./fbkeyboard [-h] [-d inputdevice] [-f font] [-r rotation]
inputdevice has to be the device node of the touchscreen, eg: /dev/input/event1.
If no inputdevice was given, the first device in /dev/input with absolute axes support will be used.
font has to be a ttf file. If no font was given, "/usr/share/fonts/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf" will be used.
rotation is a number between 0-3, 0 = normal, 1 = rotate CW, 2 = rotate 180 degrees, 3 = rotate CCW

Useful tips:
Use stty to adjust the console size to avoid overlapping the console and the keyboard.
# stty rows <number-of-rows>
